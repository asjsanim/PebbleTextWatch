Pebble Text Watch With Date
===========================

On the first launch of Pebble SDK, TextWatch application was not part of the code examples.
Many people wanted to change the texts into their own language and with this app we hope that others will improve it 
and translate it into many more languages.

A video with the text changing animation can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVTCtfZ-GsU

Updated with a stylistic date in the bottom-right corner, spelled out in words like the time.
